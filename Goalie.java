/**
* The Goalie class provides a template for the Goalie object.  Goalie 'is-a' HockeyPlayer, 
* therefore the Goalie class inherits from the HockeyPlayer class. 
* <p>
* A Goalie object has indirect access to the private lastName, position, jersey, and team 
* instance variables of its parent HockeyPlayer object.  This access is through inheritance of the 
* getLastName(), getPosition(), getJersey(), and getTeam() methods.
* <p>
* A Goalie object also has saves, shots against, wins, and save percentage values.  Getter methods
* return the current values of these for the Goalie object to which it is tethered.  A setter method calculates
* save percentage (from saves and shots against).
* <p>
* One must initialize a Goalie object with its corresponding HockeyPlayer object 
* AND values for saves, shots against, and wins.
