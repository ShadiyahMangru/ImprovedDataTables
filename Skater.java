/**
* The Skater class provides a template for the Skater object.  Skater (read: Forwards and Defense) 'is-a' HockeyPlayer, 
* therefore the Skater class inherits from the HockeyPlayer class. 
* <p>
* A Skater object has indirect access to the private lastName, position, jersey, and team 
* instance variables of its parent HockeyPlayer object.  This access is through inheritance of the 
* getLastName(), getPosition(), getJersey(), and getTeam() methods.
* <p>
* A Skater object also has games played, goals, assists, points, shots, and shooting percent values.  Getter methods
* return the current values of these for the Skater object to which it is tethered.   Setter methods 
* calculate points (from goals and assists) and shooting percent (from goals and shots).
* <p>
* One must initialize a Skater object with its corresponding HockeyPlayer object 
* AND values for games played, goals, assists and shots.
